# Drum Kit React Refactor Using Nano-React-App

## The Premise

first off, I want to point out that this project is from the 30 Javascript apps in 30 days challenge / course from Wes Bos which you can [find here](https://javascript30.com/).

While Wes Bos' original project is a very straightforward and concise app, I'm on a journey to go through the course using nano-react-app or create-react-app to convert these usually small projects into a framework.

Yes, it's impractical. No, the projects don't warrant the overhead of all the boilerplate. Yes, I will likely go back through and do the projects in MUI or Tailwind CSS for practice.

And that's the crux of it. Practice. It's practice while I'm between projects and work. ABC and keep sharp!

Now onto the project!
