nano-react-app refactor

Lemme tell ya. Doing a GH page using nano-react-app. not easy.
1. Move everything out of Dist
2. fix routes in HTML
3. fix routes for sound files in minified js (in the process de-minifying it)
4. fix routes in CSS for images (background) and make sure to put it in quotes instead of bare url. It's just easier

Now that it's done, enjoy the page!
